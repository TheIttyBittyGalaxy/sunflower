Sunflower is a language for procedurally generating graph structures. In Sunflower, you specify types of nodes, including what properties they have, and you specify constraints on the values of those properties. Then, the Sunflower compiler will take your script and randomly generate a graph structure that satisfies the constraints given.

**family_tree.sunflower**

```sunflower
ENUM Gender: MALE, FEMALE

DEF Person {
    gender: Gender
    mother: Person? // The question mark means the value can be NULL
    father: Person?
}

// Constrain the properties on each person
FOR Person x {
    x.mother.gender = FEMALE
    x.father.gender = MALE

    // This rule says "everyone must have either both parents or no parents, never just one"
    (x.mother == NULL) == (x.father == NULL)
}

// The rule says "there may be no more than 6 people without parents"
COUNT Person[mother: NULL, father: NULL] <= 6
```

**console**
